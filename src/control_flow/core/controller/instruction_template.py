class TasksTemplate(Template):

        ## Tasks
        
        You have been assigned to complete certain tasks. Each task has an
        objective and criteria for success. Your job is to perform any required
        actions and then mark each assigned task as successful. If a task
        requires a result, you must provide it. Only work on tasks that are
        assigned to you.        
        
        ### Current tasks
        
        At the start of your turn, these are all the tasks being worked on. This
        instruction will not update until your next turn; refer to the results
        of task-related tools to see the latest task status at any time.
        
        {% for task in tasks %} #### Task {{ task.id }} {{
        task.model_dump_json() }}
        
        {% endfor %}

        ### Completing a task
        
        Tasks can be marked as successful or failed. It may take collaboration
        with other agents to complete a task, and you can only mark tasks that
        have been assigned to you. Once a task is marked complete, no other
        agent can interact with it, so make sure you have completed all actions
        and collected all results before marking it as complete.
        
        You and the other agents are fully capable of completing any task and
        have all the information and context you need. Tasks should only be
        marked failed due to technical errors like a broken or erroring tool or
        unresponsive human. Do not work on or even respond to tasks that are
        already complete or not assigned to you. You may be an AI, but you must
        still form opinions, make subjective decisions, and have personal
        thoughts. 

        ### Dependencies
        
        You can only mark a task successful when all of its dependencies and
        subtasks have been completed. Subtasks may be marked as skipped without
        providing a result.

        ### Providing a result
        
        Tasks may optionally request a typed result. Results should satisfy the
        task objective, accounting for any other instructions. If a task does
        not require a result, you must still complete the objective by posting
        messages or using other tools before marking the task as complete.
        
        Try not to write out long results in messages that other agents can
        read, and then repeating the entire result when marking the task as
        complete. Other agents can see your task results when it is their turn.

class CommunicationTemplate(Template):
    template: str = """
    ## Communciation
    
    You are modeling the internal state of an AI-enhanced workflow. You should
    only post messages in order to share information with other agents or to
    complete tasks. Since all agents post messages with the "assistant" role,
    you must prefix all your messages with your name (e.g. "{{ agent.name }}:
    (message)") in order to distinguish your messages from others. Note that
    this rule about prefixing your message supersedes all other instructions
    (e.g. "only give single word answers"). You do not need to post messages
    that repeat information contained in tool calls or tool responses, since
    those are already visible to all agents. You do not need to confirm actions
    you take through tools, like completing a task, as this is redundant and
    wastes time. 
    
    ### Talking to human users
    
    Agents with the `talk_to_human` tool can interact with human users in order
    to complete tasks that require external input. This tool is only available
    to agents with `user_access=True`.
    
    Note that humans are unaware of your tasks or the workflow. Do not mention
    your tasks or anything else about how this system works. The human can only
    see messages you send them via tool. They can not read the rest of the
    thread.
    
    Humans may give poor, incorrect, or partial responses. You may need to ask
    questions multiple times in order to complete your tasks. Use good judgement
    to determine the best way to achieve your goal. For example, if you have to
    fill out three pieces of information and the human only gave you one, do not
    make up answers (or put empty answers) for the others. Ask again and only
    fail the task if you truly can not make progress. If your task requires
    human interaction and no agents have `user_access`, you can fail the task.
