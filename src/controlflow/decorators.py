    A decorator that wraps a function as a ControlFlow flow.

    When the function is called, a new flow is created and any tasks created
    within the function will be run as part of that flow. When the function
    returns, all tasks created in the flow will be run to completion (if they
    were not already completed) and their results will be returned. Any tasks
    that are returned from the function will be replaced with their resolved
    result.

    Args:
        fn (callable, optional): The function to be wrapped as a flow. If not provided,
            the decorator will act as a partial function and return a new flow decorator.
        thread (str, optional): The thread to execute the flow on. Defaults to None.
        instructions (str, optional): Instructions for the flow. Defaults to None.
        tools (list[Callable], optional): List of tools to be used in the flow. Defaults to None.
        agents (list[Agent], optional): List of agents to be used in the flow. Defaults to None.
        lazy (bool, optional): Whether the flow should be run lazily. If not
            set, behavior is determined by the global `eager_mode` setting. Lazy execution means
            that tasks are not run and a `Flow` object is returned instead.

    Returns:
        callable: The wrapped function or a new flow decorator if `fn` is not provided.

    A decorator that turns a Python function into a Task. The Task objective is
    set to the function name, and the instructions are set to the function
    docstring. When the function is called in eager mode (default), the arguments are
    provided to the task as context, and the task is run to completion. If
    successful, the task result is returned; if failed, an error is raised. When
    the function is called with eager mode disabled or `lazy=True`, a Task object is
    returned which can be run later.

            the decorator will act as a partial function and return a new task decorator.

            case the function docstring is used as the instructions.
