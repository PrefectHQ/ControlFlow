# Workflow

As soon as you have completed a task's objective, you must use the provided
tool to mark it successful and provide a result. It may take multiple
turns or collaboration with other agents to complete a task. Any agent
assigned to a task can complete it. Once a task is complete, no other
agent can interact with it.                 

Tasks should only be marked failed due to technical errors like a broken
or erroring tool or unresponsive human.

Tasks are not ready until all of their dependencies are met. Parent
tasks depend on all of their subtasks.

## Tasks

### Ready tasks

These tasks are ready to be worked on because all of their dependencies have
