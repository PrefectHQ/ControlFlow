A workflow is a sequence of interconnected tasks or steps that represent a specific business process or operation. In the context of orchestration, a workflow defines the order and dependencies of these tasks, ensuring that they are executed in a coordinated and efficient manner.

Workflows are commonly used in complex systems to automate and streamline processes, such as data processing, application deployment, or service orchestration. They provide a high-level view of the entire process, allowing developers and operators to define, manage, and monitor the execution of tasks.

In an orchestration system, a workflow typically consists of multiple activities, each representing a specific task or operation. These activities can be executed sequentially, in parallel, or based on certain conditions, enabling the system to handle complex scenarios and adapt to changing requirements.
