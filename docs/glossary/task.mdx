Tasks are the building blocks of ControlFlow workflows. Each task represents a discrete objective for agents to solve, such as generating text, classifying data, or extracting information from a document. In addition, tasks can specify instructions, tools for agents to use, a schema for the expected output, and more. 

Tasks can depend on each other in various ways, creating complex workflows that are easy to understand and manage:
- **sequential** dependencies: one task must be completed before another can start
- **context** dependencies: the result of one task is used as input for another
- **subtask** dependencies: a task has subtasks that must be completed before the task can be considered done

By specifying the parameters of each task and how they relate to each other, developers can create complex workflows that are easy to understand and manage.
