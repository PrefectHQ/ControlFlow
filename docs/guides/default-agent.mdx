title: Configuring Default Agents
---

ControlFlow uses a default agent when no specific agents are assigned to a task. Understanding how to configure and override this default agent at different levels can help you create more flexible and customized workflows.

## Changing the Global Default Agent

The global default agent (whose name, of course, is Marvin) uses whatever [default model](/guides/llms#changing-the-default-model) you've configured. It has a basic set of general-purpose instructions and is not equipped with any tools.

To change the global default agent, assign a new agent to the `default_agent` attribute of the `controlflow` module:

```python
import controlflow as cf

# Create a new agent
agent = cf.Agent('Deep Thought', instructions='Answer every question with 42')

# Set the global default agent
cf.default_agent = agent

# Create a task without specifying an agent
task = cf.Task('What is 2 + 2?')
task.run()  # Result: 42
```

## Changing a Flow's Default Agent

You can also set a default agent (or agents) for a specific flow. This allows you to use different default agents for different parts of your application without changing the global default.

To set a default agent for a flow, use the `agents` parameter when decorating your flow function:

```python
import controlflow as cf

researcher = cf.Agent('Researcher', instructions='Conduct thorough research')
writer = cf.Agent('Writer', instructions='Write clear, concise content')

@cf.flow(agents=[researcher, writer])
def research_flow():
    research_task = cf.Task("Research the topic")
    writing_task = cf.Task("Write a report")
    return writing_task

result = research_flow()
```

In this example, both the `research_task` and `writing_task` will use the `researcher` and `writer` agents by default.

## Agent Selection Precedence

When ControlFlow needs to assign an agent to a task, it follows this precedence:

1. Agents specified directly on the task (`task.agents`)
2. Agents specified for the flow (`@flow(agents=[...])`)
3. The global default agent (`cf.default_agent`)

This means you can always override the default agent by specifying agents directly on a task, regardless of what default agents are set at the flow or global level.

```python
import controlflow as cf

global_agent = cf.Agent('Global', instructions='I am the global default')
cf.default_agent = global_agent

flow_agent = cf.Agent('Flow', instructions='I am the flow default')

task_agent = cf.Agent('Task', instructions='I am specified for this task')

@cf.flow(agents=[flow_agent])
def example_flow():
    task1 = cf.Task("Task with flow default")
    task2 = cf.Task("Task with specific agent", agents=[task_agent])
    return task1, task2

results = example_flow()
```

In this example:
- `task1` will use the `flow_agent`
- `task2` will use the `task_agent`
- If we created a task outside of `example_flow`, it would use the `global_agent`

By understanding and utilizing these different levels of agent configuration, you can create more flexible and customized workflows in ControlFlow.
