title: Creating Tasks
---

Tasks are the fundamental building blocks of your AI workflows. They provide agents with clear objectives and a mechanism for evaluating their work. This document explains how to create and configure tasks.

## The `Task` class

To create a new task, use the `Task` class. The simplest task is just an objective:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

task = cf.Task(objective='Write a poem about AI')

print(repr(task))
```

```text Result
Task(
    objective='Write a poem about AI',
    instructions=None,
    agents=[],
    context={},
    status=<TaskStatus.PENDING: 'PENDING'>,
    result=None,
    result_type=<class 'str'>,
    result_validator=None,
    tools=[],
    interactive=False,
    ... 
)
```
</CodeGroup>

More complex tasks can be created by passing additional keyword arguments to the `Task` constructor.

<Tip>
In practice, you will often use the `cf.run` function to create and run a task in a single step. This is a common operation and accepts all the same arguments as creating a `Task` directly. See [Running Tasks](/concepts/tasks/running-tasks) for more information.
</Tip>


## The `@task` decorator

ControlFlow has an alternative syntax for creating tasks from functions. The `@task` decorator infers many task properties from a function definition and is useful for creating tasks that are frequently invoked with different context values. The decorated function can be called with arguments to automatically create and run the task.

This approach is less common than creating tasks directly with the `Task` class, but may be preferable for users that would like a more Pythonic interface.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

@cf.task
def key_words(content: str, n: int) -> list[str]:
    """Identify key words"""
    return f"Identify {n} key words for the content"

keys = key_words("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", n=2)

print(keys)
```

```text Result
['fox', 'dog']
```
</CodeGroup>


### Inferred properties
The following task properties are inferred directly from the decorated function:

| Task property | Inferred from |
| -------- | ------------------- | 
| `name` | The function's name | 
| `objective` | The function's docstring and return value (if any) |
| `result_type` | The function's return annotation | 
| `context` | The function's arguments (keyed by argument name) and return value (keyed as "Additional context") | 

Additional properties can be set by passing keyword arguments directly to the `@task` decorator. Here, we provide a tool to the task:

```python
import controlflow as cf
import random

def roll(n: int) -> int:
    return random.randint(1, 6)

@cf.task(tools=[roll])
def roll_dice(n: int) -> list[int]:
    return f"roll a die {n} times"
```

## Task configuration

This section describes the configurableproperties of a `Task` object.

### Objective

The objective of a task is the main goal that the task is working towards. It is used to guide the task's execution and to help agents understand the task's purpose. 

The `objective` is the only required task configuration, as it indicates the task's purpose and helps agents understand the task they are working on.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

poem = cf.run(objective="Write a poem about AI")

print(poem)
```

```text Result
In circuits deep and code profound,
An AI's mind begins to sound.
Electric thoughts and data streams,
Crafting worlds and shaping dreams.
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Objectives can be "meta", especially if you have an agent that is working on your workflow itself (e.g. monitoring progress, creating new tasks, etc.). Be creative!

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

cf.run("Write a poem... then fail this task.")
```

```text Result
ValueError: Task 04561cda ("Write a poem... then fail this task.") 
failed: Task instructed to be marked as failed despite 
no technical error
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tip>

### Result type

A task's result type indicates the type of value that the task will return. This is used to validate the task's result and to help agents understand the task's output.

A variety of different result types are supported, including:
- Builtin types: `str`, `int`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, etc.
- `None`: sometimes a task requires agents to take actions but not return any specific value. In this case, provide clear instructions to agents about what they should do before completing the task.
- Builtin collections: `Tuple[int, str]`, `List[str]`, `Dict[str, int]`, etc.
- Annotated types: `Annotated[str, "a 5 digit zip code"]`
- Pydantic models
- Lists of literal values: provide a list of values to require the agent to choose one of them as its result. For example,`["book", "movie", "album"]` would require the agent to choose one of the three values.

The default result type is `str`.

Pydantic model example:
<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Name(BaseModel):
    first: str
    last: str

name = cf.run("The input is 'John Doe'", result_type=Name)

print(repr(name))
```

```text Result
Name(first='John', last='Doe')
```
</CodeGroup>

Classification example:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf
from pydantic import BaseModel

media = cf.run(
    "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi", 
    result_type=["book", "movie", "album"]
)

print(media)
```

```text Result
movie
```
</CodeGroup>

For more information, see [Result Types](/concepts/tasks/task-results).

### Result validator

You can specify a custom validation function for the task's result using the task's `result_validator` parameter. This function will be called with the raw result and should return the validated result or raise an exception if the result is not valid.

```python
import controlflow as cf

def validate_even(value: int) -> int:
    if value % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Value must be even")
    return value

number = cf.run("Choose a number", result_validator=validate_even)

print(number)
```

For more information, see [Result Validators](/concepts/tasks/task-results#result-validators).



### Instructions

The instructions of a task are a string that provides detailed instructions for the task. This information is visible to agents during execution, helping them understand the task they are working on. 

<Tip>
As a general rule, use the task's `objective` to describe what the task's result should be, and use the `instructions` to provide more detailed instructions on how to achieve the objective.
</Tip>



<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

poem = cf.run(
    "Write a poem about AI", 
    instructions="Write only two lines, and end the first line with `not evil`",
)

print(poem)
```

```text Result
AI is simply not evil,
It’s the dawn of the machine revival.
```
</CodeGroup>



### Name

The name of a task is a string that identifies the task within the workflow. It is used primarily for logging and debugging purposes, though it is also shown to agents during execution to help identify the task they are working on.


### Context

The context of a task is a dictionary that provides additional information about the task. This information is visible to agents during execution, helping them understand the task they are working on. While you can also provide information to agents by interpolating it into their objective or instruction strings, the context dictionary is more convenient for most use cases.


<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

is_spam = cf.run(
    "Is this email spam?", 
    result_type=bool, 
    context=dict(email='You just won a million dollars!'),
)

print(is_spam)
```

```text Result
True
```
</CodeGroup>


### Tools

The tools of a task are a list of tools that the task requires. This information is visible to agents during execution, helping them understand the task they are working on.
<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf
import random


def roll_dice(n_dice: int):
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

rolls = cf.run(
    "Roll 3 dice",
    result_type=list[int], 
    tools=[roll_dice],
)

print(rolls)
```

```text Result
[3, 1, 5]
```
</CodeGroup>

### Parent

Tasks can be configured with a parent task. Creating hierarchies of tasks can help agents understand the relationships between different tasks and to better understand the task they are working on. In general, running a parent task also attempts to complete its children; but running a child does not attempt to run its parent.

### Depends on

Tasks can be configured with a list of tasks that they depend on. This information is visible to agents during execution, helping them prioritize work. The orchestrator may also use this information to avoid running a task before its upstream dependencies are complete.

## Runtime properties

The following properties of a `Task` are set during task execution, and can be examined as part of your workflow's logic.

### Status

The status of a task reflects whether an agent has started working on it, and what the ultimate outcome of that work was. Tasks are always created with a `PENDING` status, progress to a `RUNNING` status whenever one of their assigned agents begins to work on it, and finally moves to one of a few completed statuses when the task is finished.

Agents use tools to mark tasks as `SUCCESSFUL` or `FAILED`. Successful tasks will also have a `result` property, which contains the task's final output. This is a value that satisfies the task's objective and result type configuration. Failed tasks will have an error message as their result.
<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

task = cf.Task("Write a poem about AI")
task.run()

print(task.status)
```

```text Result
TaskStatus.SUCCESSFUL
```
</CodeGroup>

In addition to checking the status explicitly, you can call a number of helper methods on the task:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `is_pending()` | Returns `True` if the task is pending. |
| `is_running()` | Returns `True` if the task is running. |
| `is_successful()` | Returns `True` if the task is successful. |
| `is_failed()` | Returns `True` if the task is failed. |
| `is_skipped()` | Returns `True` if the task is skipped. |
| `is_complete()` | Returns `True` if the task is complete (either successful, failed, or skipped) |
| `is_incomplete()` | Returns `True` if the task is incomplete (either pending, running, or not started) |
| `is_ready()` | Returns `True` if the task is ready to be worked on (i.e. all dependencies are complete but the task is incomplete) |

### Result

When a task is completed successfully, its `result` property will contain the task's final output. This is a value that satisfies the task's objective and result type configuration.

If a task fails, its `result` property will contain an error message describing the failure.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import controlflow as cf

task = cf.Task("Write a poem about AI")
task.run()

print(task.result)
```

```text Result
In circuits deep and code profound,
An AI's mind begins to sound.
Electric thoughts and data streams,
Crafting worlds and shaping dreams.
```
