Agents are a key concept in ControlFlow, representing the AI entities responsible for executing tasks within a workflow. Each agent has its own set of properties, methods, and capabilities that define its behavior and role in the flow.

## Creating an Agent

To create an agent, you can use the `Agent` class provided by ControlFlow. Here's an example of how to create an agent:

```python
from controlflow import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="DataAnalyst",
    description="An AI agent specialized in data analysis",
    instructions="Perform data analysis tasks efficiently and accurately",
    tools=[pandas_tool, matplotlib_tool]
)
```

In this example, we create an agent named "DataAnalyst" with a description and specific instructions. The `tools` parameter is used to provide the agent with a list of tools it can use during task execution. These tools are essentially Python functions that the agent can call at any time.

## Agent Properties

An agent has the following key properties:

- `name` (str): The name of the agent, which serves as an identifier and is visible to other agents in the workflow.
- `description` (str, optional): A brief description of the agent's role or specialization, which is also visible to other agents.
- `instructions` (str, optional): Specific instructions or guidelines for the agent to follow during task execution. These instructions are private to the agent and not visible to other agents.
- `tools` (List[ToolType], optional): A list of tools available to the agent. Tools are Python functions that the agent can call to perform specific actions or computations.
- `user_access` (bool, default=False): Indicates whether the agent has access to user interactions. If set to `True`, the agent will be provided with the `talk_to_human` tool to communicate with users.

These properties help define the agent's characteristics, behavior, and capabilities within the flow.

## Assigning Agents to Tasks

To assign an agent to a task, you can use the `agents` parameter when creating a task. Here's an example:

```python
from controlflow import Task

task = Task(
    objective="Analyze sales data",
    agents=[data_analyst, data_visualizer]
)
```

In this example, we create a task with the objective "Analyze sales data" and assign two agents, `data_analyst` and `data_visualizer`, to it. Agents can only work on tasks they are assigned to.

## Running Agents

The `Agent` class provides a `run()` method to take low-level control of an agent's execution. Here's an example of how to run an agent:

```python
from controlflow import Agent, Task, Flow

agent = Agent(name="DataAnalyst")
task = Task(objective="Analyze sales data", agents=[agent])

with Flow():
    while task.is_incomplete():
        agent.run(task)
```

In this example, we create an agent and a task, and assign the agent to the task. We then use a while loop to run the agent repeatedly until the task is marked as complete.

Agents can not be run manually outside a flow context, because the flow is necessary for maintaining the shared history and context across invocations.

## User Access and Interaction

Agents with the `user_access` flag set to `True` have the ability to interact with users using the `talk_to_human` tool. This tool allows agents to send messages to users and receive responses.

```python
from controlflow import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="UserAssistant",
    description="An AI agent that interacts with users",
    user_access=True
)
```

In this example, we create an agent named "UserAssistant" with the `user_access` flag set to `True`. This agent will have access to the `talk_to_human` tool to communicate with users when necessary.
