title: Core Concepts
---

**ControlFlow is built on three core concepts** that are essential to understanding how the framework works. These concepts are designed to make it easy to build and manage complex AI workflows, while also providing a clear structure for developers to follow.

## ðŸš¦ Task
**Tasks are the building blocks of ControlFlow workflows**. Each task represents a discrete objective for agents to solve, such as generating text, classifying data, or extracting information from a document. In addition, tasks can specify instructions, tools for agents to use, a schema for the expected output, and more. 

Tasks can depend on each other in various ways, creating complex workflows that are easy to understand and manage:
- **sequential** dependencies: one task must be completed before another can start
- **context** dependencies: the result of one task is used as input for another
- **subtask** dependencies: a task has subtasks that must be completed before the task can be considered done

By specifying the parameters of each task and how they relate to each other, developers can create complex workflows that are easy to understand and manage.

## ðŸŒŠ Flow
**A flow represents an entire agentic workflow.** It is a "container" for the workflow that maintains consistent context and state across all tasks and agents. Each flow executes on a different thread, meaning all agents in the flow see the same state and can communicate with each other. 

## ðŸ¤– Agent
**Agents are the AI "workers" that complete tasks.** Each agent can have distinct instructions, personality, and capabilities, and they are responsible for completing any tasks assigned to them. Agents can be specialized for specific tasks or more general-purpose, depending on the requirements of the workflow.
